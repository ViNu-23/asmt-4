**Vite + ReactJS Project README**

Welcome to our Vite + ReactJS project! This repository contains a starter template for building ReactJS applications with Vite, a blazing fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience. Below are instructions on how to get started with cloning the repository, downloading it as a zip file, opening the code in Visual Studio Code, and installing the required libraries.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository using Git, follow these steps:

Copy the repository URL and run the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of this repository and `<project-directory>` with the directory name you want to use for your project.

### Downloading as ZIP File

If you prefer not to use Git, you can download the repository as a ZIP file by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the repository's GitHub page.
2. Click on the "Code" button.
3. Select "Download ZIP".
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to your desired location.

### Opening Code in Visual Studio Code

Once you have the project files on your machine, you can open them in Visual Studio Code (or any other code editor of your choice) by following these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to File -> Open...
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the repository.
4. Select the folder containing the project files.
5. Click "Open".

### Installing Required Libraries

Before running the project, you need to install the required libraries. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine. Then, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

### Running the Project

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command will start the development server and open your default browser to view the application. Any changes you make to the source code will be hot-reloaded, allowing for a smooth development experience.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

```
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized production build in the dist directory.
